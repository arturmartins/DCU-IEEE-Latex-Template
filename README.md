# DCU IEEE MCM Latex Template

This is the structure that I used to deliver my practicum DCU 2023/2024.
It's based on IEEE 2 column paper.

Feel free to fork and to use it to quickly start writing your practicum.

I recommend using [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) as it allows others to collaborate or to comment the paper (supervisor), sync with zotero references and integrate with github (paid version required for Zotero Sync and Git/Github Integration).

TODO:
- Build a docker image to generate the PDF file (Pull Requests welcome!)
